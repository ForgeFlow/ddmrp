We strongly recommend to modify the configuration of the reservation method
to manual in the outgoing operation types (so deliveries
related to Sales Orders aren't automatically reserved) and to avoid to
reserve stock for specific moves, buffers are in fact a reservation of stock.
However, while **reservation is discouraged**, it is still available to be
used, in case of reserved stock be aware that the buffer will be blind to this
transfers and stock and you are bypassing the DDMRP reordering flow.
